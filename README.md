# Theory Of Algorithms
This repository contains work from my 4th year theory of algorithms module for college. For this module we were assigned a number of tasks which we had to complete.

### Problems
1. Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that uses a brute-force algorithm that takes a single positive integer and return true if the number is a prime and false otherwise. Call the function `decide-prime`.

2. Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that takes a positive integer n0 as input and returns a list by recursively applying the following operation, starting with the input number.

    ```
    ni + 1 = 3ni + 1 if ni is odd
    ni + 1 = ni Ã· 2 otherwise
    ```

   End the recursion when (or if) the number becomes 1. Call the function `collatz-list`. So, `collatz-list` should return a list whose first element is n0, the second element is n1, and so on. For example:

    ```
    > (collatz-list 5)
    '(5 16 8 4 2 1)
    > (collatz-list 9)
    '(9 28 14 7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1)
    > (collatz-list 2)
    '(2 1)
    ```

3. Write, from scratch, two functions in Racket. The first is called `lcycle`. It takes a list as input and returns the list cyclically shifted one place to the left. The second is called `rcycle`, and it returns the list cyclically shifted one place to the right. For example:

    ```
    > (lcycle (list 1 2 3 4 5))
    '(2 3 4 5 1)
    > (rcycle (list 1 2 3 4 5))
    '(5 1 2 3 4)
    ```

4. Write a function `sublsum` in Racket that takes a list (of integers) as input and returns a list of sublists of it that sum to zero. For this problem, you can use the `combinations` built-in function. Note the order of the sublists and their elements doesnâ€™t matter. For example:

    ```
    > (sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 -5))
    '((2 3 -5) (-5 1 4))
    > (sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 5))
    '()
    ```

5. Write a function `hamming-weight` in Racket that takes a list `l` as input and returns the number of non-zero elements in it. For example:

    ```
    > (hamming-weight (list 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0))
    5
    ```

6. Write a function `hamming-distance` in Racket that takes two lists and returns the number of positions in which they differ. For example:

    ```
    > (hamming-distance (list 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0) (list 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0))
    5
    ```
