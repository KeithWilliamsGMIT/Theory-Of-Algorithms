# Theory Of Algorithms
This repository contains work from my 4th year theory of algorithms module for college. For this module we were assigned a number of tasks which we had to complete.

### Problems
1. Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that uses a brute-force algorithm that takes a single positive integer and return true if the number is a prime and false otherwise. Call the function `decide-prime`.
